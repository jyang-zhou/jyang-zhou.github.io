# Decision-Tree-Random-Forest-Classification

A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression problems. It is simply a series of sequential decisions made to reach a specific result.

But often, a single tree is not sufficient for producing effective results. Random Forest is a tree-based machine learning algorithm that leverages the power of multiple decision trees for making decisions.

# Dataset

The [dataset](https://github.com/jyang-zhou/Decision-Tree-Random-Forest-Classification/blob/main/Social_Network_Ads.csv) consists of 400 rows and 3 features, including Age, EstimatedSalary, and Purchased. Here, the target variable is Purchased, which indicates whether a person purchased the item or not.

## Dataset Sample
|Age|EstimatedSalary|Purchased|
|---|---------------|---------|
|19|19000|0|
|35|20000|0|
|32|150000|1|
